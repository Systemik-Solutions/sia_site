# Markdown HTML

Hi, this is a simple Markdown document that can be converted to HTML.

## Intro

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its key design goal is readability â€“ that the language be readable as-is, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

## Features

Here's a list of some basic Markdown syntax:::

1. **Bold text** with `**` or `__`.
2. *Italic text* with `*` or `_`.
3. [Links](https://www.example.com) with `[text](URL)`.
4. Lists, like this one.
5. Blockquotes:

6. Code:

    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```

## Conclusion

Markdown is awesome!
