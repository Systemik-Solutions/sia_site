# Divergence

Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD, or simply Divergence) is a measure of the similarity or difference between two Text Sets. It is based on proportional frequencies of words. It provides a single measure of difference between samples relying on multiple component word frequencies. A typical application is to compare all the words in a collection to the overall average of that collection. Which words are typical, and which words are aberrant?

By looking at the individual word-variables which contribute most to the Divergence score you can quickly determine whether a handful of words have largely created the divergence, or not, and look at what these words are – typically a very common word with a very high or very low proportional frequency, or a usually rare word used intensively in one of the Text Sets.

An example of how you might use Divergence is…
