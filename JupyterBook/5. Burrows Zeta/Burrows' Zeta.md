# Burrows' Zeta

Burrows’ Zeta is a method for using the frequencies of mid-range words for a classification exercise. We take a Text Set of Class A samples and a Text Set of Class B samples. Which words which are used regularly in Class A and rarely in Class B, and vice-versa? Each sample in the analysis is then given two scores, based on how many of the words in the two lists occur in it.  A mystery sample which has many of the Class A words in its vocabulary and rather few of the Class B words can be assigned to Class A.

An example of how you might use Burrows’ Zeta is…
